# Landing-Page-Project
This is my second project that was completed under The Odin Project
This is a landing page created using a templete set by the course.

The images used in thsi project do not belong to be and are from the following sites:

-- Chef Image (hero image) - https://www.finedininglovers.com/article/how-become-successful-chef
-- Spinach Risotto Image - https://www.italianstylecooking.net/en/spinach-risotto/
-- Steak Image - https://www.seriouseats.com/sous-vide-steaks-recipe
-- Seafood Paella Image - https://simply-delicious-food.com/seafood-paella/
-- Shrimp Alfredo Image - https://thecozycook.com/shrimp-alfredo/

This project taught me a lot more aboyt working with "display:flex"  and how to structure my HTML elements in such a way that I can display the elements in the intended way.

I also learned how to properly use the "section" element after previously trying to do it on my own.

This was overall a very fun project to do.
